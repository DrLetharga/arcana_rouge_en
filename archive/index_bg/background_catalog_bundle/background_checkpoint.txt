Background Cataloging Checkpoint
-------------------------------
Last Finalized Background: xig03_cut002_02.png
Catalog File: index_bg90.csv
Next Background Expected: xig03_cut003_03.png (or next available)
Script Encoding: UTF-8 without BOM
Notes:
- Extract 5 lines before and after [bg storage="..."] calls, [img_c storage="..."], or [image storage="..."] calls.
- Mark backgrounds as UNUSED if no references found.
- Continue building catalog with Filename, Scene Type, Time of Day, Mood, Notes, Suggested Tags, Script File, and Index fields.
- Special effects like HAMON (ripple), TV filters, and grayscale shifts should be noted in Suggested Tags and Notes.
- Each line where the background is found should be a unique row with its own unique Mood, Notes, Suggested Tags, and Index (line).
