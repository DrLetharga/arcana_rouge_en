# Background Image Guidelines

Backgrounds provide setting and tone for a scene. Translators should adjust language for immersion, mood, and alignment with visual shifts.

- **Location:** `source/g_bg/` or as specified.
- **Tag Match:** `[bg storage="bg001a"]` → `bg001a.png`
- **Purpose:** Establish mood (serene, eerie, chaotic, dreamlike).
- **Best Practices:**
  - Use atmospheric descriptions sparingly.
  - Modify tone of narration or dialogue if scenery shifts dramatically.
  - Maintain character voice and emotional trajectory.

**Examples:**
- Calm sky → Add peace, wonder, or anticipation to internal monologue.
- Battlefield → Sharpen tone, raise urgency, emphasize danger.
