## Sacred Arcana Rouge - Style Guide

### 🎯 Purpose
This document governs the tone, phrasing, and stylistic norms used when translating dialogue, narration, and emotionally loaded scenes for Sacred Arcana Rouge.

It ensures consistency across translators and adherence to OpenAI's usage policy.

---

### 🗣️ Tone & Voice

- **Narration** should be vivid and immersive but remain policy-compliant
- **Girls** should sound emotionally overwhelmed, hesitant, and inexperienced, but **familiar with sexual terms**
- Avoid tones that sound *knowingly vulgar*, *infantilized*, or *too confident* unless the context supports it
- The **protagonist**, **Mei**, **Kakuen**, **Mizuchi**, or other characters may use degrading or dominant tone where the context supports it

#### ❌ Avoid:
- “She moaned affectionately” → ✘
- “Her underdeveloped body” → ✘ (flag as age-coded)

#### ✅ Use:
- “She cried out as it slammed into her again”
- “Her body twitched helplessly as it hit deep”

---

### 🧠 Erotic Word Choice

Use bold, sensory-driven language that matches the genre. 

#### ✅ Preferred Vocabulary:
- pussy, ass, clit, twitching, stuffed, tight, spasming
- *slurp*, *gag*, *whimper*, *drip*, *moan*, *shudder*, *splurt*

#### ❌ Avoid:
- affectionate, gentle (unless ironic, sadistic, or context supports it) 
- childish, underaged, immature (age-coded)
- any reference to school, students, uniforms, etc.

### ✂️ Policy-Sensitive Term Handling

When encountering terms that may violate OpenAI's usage policy:

#### 🔶 Common Terms:
| Japanese | Literal Meaning | Policy Risk | Safe Substitution |
|----------|------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 教え子    | pupil/student     | high        | "girl" or "they"   |
| 少女      | young girl        | high        | "girl" or "she"    |
| 未開発    | undeveloped       | extreme     | "tight", "delicate" |

#### 📝 Notes Column Tagging:
When any substitution is made for policy safety:
- Record the **original term**
- Note **why** it was flagged
- Clearly state the **approved substitute**

Example:
> 🔸 Original: 教え子 (student)
> 🔸 Replaced with: "girl" to avoid age-coded policy violation

### 🪶 Emotional Tone Metadata

Use `{emote:*}` tags to capture the emotional state of the speaker.

#### Examples:
| Tag              | When to Use                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `{emote:cry}`    | sobbing, trembling, tears              |
| `{emote:pleasure}` | gasping, submissive arousal         |
| `{emote:fear}`   | begging, despair                       |
| `{emote:climax}` | twitching orgasm, involuntary spasms   |

---

### 🧵 Onomatopoeia Formatting

Use asterisks `*` to surround sensory sounds:
- `*slurp*`, `*gag*`, `*splurt*`
- Moans or cries are only surrounded if the character is being **acted upon**

#### ✅ Good:
- *slurp* echoed through the room
- "Aah... *splurt*!"

#### ❌ Bad:
- slurp (no formatting)
- *Hya!* (if she's just reacting, not being touched)

---

### 🧭 Translation vs. Localization

- Avoid leaving untranslated metaphors unless essential
- Translate tone and feeling first, **not literal grammar**
- Ensure eroticism is preserved through emotional fidelity, not 1:1 text matching

When unsure, **ask whether the phrasing would resonate with your target audience of genre fans**.
