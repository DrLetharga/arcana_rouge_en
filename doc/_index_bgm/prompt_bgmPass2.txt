As far as an initial analysis of all BGM, all files are done.  Attached is index_bgm20.csv which is my final working copy at this time.

I have also attached s_bgm.zip.  This archive contains all the BGM##.ogg files that have been processed.  Use them for verification if needed.

I'd like you to do a 2nd pass using index_bgm20.csv.  Verify the BGM is being used in the files and the lines indicated based on start line and end line.

Also, determine more context after you check an entry to see if the tone and notes can be better defined or expanded upon.

Do this 1 record at a time.  Stop once you reach a new BGM file.  Then, verify the results with me.
