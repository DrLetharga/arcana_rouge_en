# Using the Akane Audio Drama for TTS Training

The game includes a 21-minute, 53-second audio drama featuring a sexual encounter with Akane. This is a significant asset for training a voice model due to its rich emotional range and natural delivery.

## ‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Valuable

- Captures **extended emotional progression**
- Includes **crying, moaning, gasping, and climaxing**
- Provides **breath control**, **pacing**, and **tone shifts**
- High-quality, continuous **natural delivery** from the original seiyuu

## ‚úÖ Usage Options

### 1. Unsupervised Voice Cloning
Use the full audio as a **reference embedding**:
- Great for models like YourTTS, Resemble-style encoders
- No transcription needed
- Extracts Akane‚Äôs *style and tone* for use in English synthesis

---

### 2. Whisper / WhisperX Auto-Transcription
- Use OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper or WhisperX to auto-transcribe the Japanese dialogue
- Segment the 21-minute file into smaller WAV files (e.g. 5‚Äì10 second clips)
- Result: usable data for training phoneme-rich emotional delivery

**Example metadata entry:**
```
akane_audio_012.wav|„ÅÇ„Å£‚Ä¶‚Ä¶„Åù„Åì‚Ä¶‚Ä¶„Å†„ÇÅ„ÄÅ„Å†„ÇÅ„Åá„Å£‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
```

### 3. Manual English Translation Alignment (Advanced)
- Auto-segment with WhisperX for timestamps
- Manually translate each segment
- Create a **parallel training dataset**: Japanese audio ‚Üí English text

Result: a dataset for emotion-aligned English generation in Akane‚Äôs voice
