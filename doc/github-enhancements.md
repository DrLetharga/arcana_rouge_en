# GitHub Enhancements for Translation Project

To streamline translation workflow, the following GitHub features can be leveraged:

## Issues & Labels
- Use GitHub Issues to report awkward lines, bugs, or tone mismatches.
- Apply labels such as `jazz`, `noboner`, `ruby_macro`, `needs tone adjustment`, etc.

## Pull Requests
- Use Pull Requests for major edits or tone revisions.
- Enable line-by-line review to track macro preservation and script tone consistency.

## Discussions
- Use GitHub Discussions for:
  - Tone debate
  - Word choice comparisons
  - Community polls on phrasing

## Projects
- Create a GitHub Project board to track progress:
  - Columns like: To Do, Translating, Needs Review, Finalized
  - Cards per scene or script file

## Releases
- Use tagged releases to share milestones: "Partial Patch 1," "Demo Translation," etc.
- Include zip of translated scripts for test deployment.

## Wiki (optional)
- Maintain a wiki for translation theory, examples, or plugin behaviors.
- Could house a reference for macro definitions or encoding quirks.
